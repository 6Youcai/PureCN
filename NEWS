Changes in version 1.8.0
------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Support for off-target reads in copy number normalization and segmentation
    o Added mutation burden calculation
    o Code cleanups (switch to GRanges where possible, switch to optparse in 
      command line tools)
    o More robust mapping bias estimation
    o Added support for CNVkit coverage files (*.cnn, *.cnr)
    o IntervalFile.R can annotate targets with gene symbols and automatically
      convert chromosome naming styles.
    o Better artifact filtering by using normalDB more efficiently
    o Support for mappability scores
    o Coverage calculation can now include duplicates 
    o Segments are now flagged when allele-specific copy number is unreliable
      due to insufficient number of high quality variants
    o findBestNormal pooling now read count based, not coverage based  
    o Experimental support for GATK4

API CHANGES

    o Due to novel optimizations of provided bait intervals, we recommend 
      to regenerate the normal databases and recalculate all coverages from
      BAM files
    o New functions: annotateTargets, callMutationBurden
    o Defunct functions: createSNPBlacklist, getDiploid, autoCurateResults,
      readCoverageGatk
    o min.normals defaults to 2 (changed from 4) in setMappingBiasVcf
    o normalDB.min.coverage defaults to 0.25 (changed from 0.2) in filterTargets
    o log.ratio.calibration defaults to 0.1 (from 0.25) in runAbsoluteCN; now 
      relative to purity, not log-ratio noise
    o Removed gc.data from filterTargets since gc_bias is now added to tumor 
      coverage
    o dropped purecn.output from correctCoverageBias (no two-pass anymore)
    o Coverage.R argument --gatkcoverage renamed to --coverage
    o Dropped GC-normalization functionality in NormalDB, since this is 
      now conveniently done in Coverage.R
    o Renamed PureCN.R --outdir argument to --out. Can now specify a file
      prefix as in GATK. Filenames are thus not forced to sample id anymore.  
      If --out is a directory, it will behave like before and will use
      out/sampleid_suffix as filename.
 
PLANNED FEATURES FOR 1.10

    o More sample summary statistics, like chromosomal instability
    o Better performance in high purity samples with significant heterogeneity  
    o LOH database
    o Switch to S4 data structures (maybe)
    o Switch the HDF5 for mapping bias database
    o Whole dataset visualizations (maybe)
    o Better support for known, small deletions and amplifications (e.g. EGFRvIII,
      MYC)
    o Support for GATK4
    o Better runtime performance by ignoring unlikely solutions early
